# SimpleWebscrapingProject
This is my first web scraping project: it is a guided project from the course 'IBM Data Science Professional Certificate'
*Websites sources for web scraping and plotly function has been provided from IBM on Coursera as a part of the excercise*

The project starts from extracting data from web pages and yfinance API aiming at creating a very basic dashboard.
I am practicing with requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for manual webscraping, using also pandas to automatically extract tables. 
Finally the goal is to use plotly to create a simple dashboard to visualize extracted data.

# Project description
I first extracted stocks data from Tesla using yfinance library, then I webscraped the provided URL with both requests-BeautifulSoup and pandas to extract Tesla revenues.
The same thing was done for GameStop data.
Lastly I used the provided function to plot the graphs of stocks and revenues.

# Code Evolution
This project not only demonstrates web scraping and data visualization techniques but also reflects my learning process. In the first part, the code is more redundant and repetitive as I implement concepts step by step. As the project goes on, the code becomes more streamlined and efficient, applying best practices and adequates functions.

# Next Steps
The next step in this project is to replace the provided plotting function with a custom implementation. This will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of data visualization using Plotly and to tailor the charts more precisely to the extracted data. Additionally, it will help me practice writing modular and reusable functions.
