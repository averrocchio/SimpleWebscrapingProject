# SimpleWebscrapingProject
This is my first webscraping project: it is a guided project from the course 'IBM Data Science Professional Certificate'

It shoud go from extracting data from some web pages and yfinance and create a dashboard.
In this project I am practicing with requests and BeautifulSoup library for manual webscraping but I am also using pandas to automatically extract tables. 
After that the goal is to use plotly to create a dashboard to visualize extracted data.
