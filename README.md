# SimpleWebscrapingProject
This is my first webscraping project: it is a guided project from the course 'IBM Data Science Professional Certificate'

It shoud go from extracting data from some web pages and yfinance and create a dashboard.
In this project I am practicing with requests and BeautifulSoup library for manual webscraping but I am also using pandas to automatically extract tables. 
After that the goal is to use plotly to create a dashboard to visualize extracted data.

# project description
In this project I first extracted stocks data from tesla using yfinance lirary, then I webscraped the provided url with both requests-BeautifulSoup and pandas to extract Tesla revenues.
Then I did the same thing for GameStop data.
Last I used the provided function to plot the graphs of stocks and revenues.

# Code Evolution
This project not only demonstrates web scraping and data visualization techniques but also reflects my learning process. In the first part, the code is more redundant and repetitive as I implement concepts step by step. As the project progresses, the code becomes more streamlined and efficient, applying best practices and improving reusability.

# Next Steps
The next step in this project is to replace the provided plotting function with a custom implementation. This will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of data visualization using Plotly and to tailor the charts more precisely to the extracted data. Additionally, it will help me practice writing modular and reusable functions.
